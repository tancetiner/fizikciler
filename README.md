# Fizikciler

A simple 2D game built with python using the module "Pygame".

### Introduction
Honestly, my motivation was to mess with my friends from college (Tan, Can, Yagiz and Pamir) while learning a new python module. That means the game features them, at least their faces. You can pick a character between me, Tan (the other Tan, obviously), Can and Yagiz. Your aim is to try not to caught by Pamir (but 4 of them). 

### Installation
You can download the project as zip and run the "fizikciler.py" on your local machine. (Please see dependencies)

### Dependencies

- Python 3
- Pygame module

And that's it!
